## Style Guidelines:

- Dark color scheme for the background to enhance visual focus. To arrive at the color, I considered the User Request, and decided to choose a color that evokes a professional visual aesthetic. The background color will be approximately HSL 240, 20%, 15% which expressed in RGB Hex is #1A1D29
- Primary color: Violet (#8A2BE2) to evoke artistry.
- Accent color: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF) to provide high contrast for call-to-action elements and highlights. The accent is analogous to violet; since the primary's hue is approximately 265, I set the accent to around 210, and raised the saturation and luminance compared to the primary.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, offering a modern yet readable style. To choose these fonts, I followed the recommendations of fonts suitable for bold styling, with short text in most of the display.
- Minimalist, line-based icons for clear visual communication.
- Clean, grid-based layout to display images efficiently.
- Subtle transitions and hover effects to improve UX.
